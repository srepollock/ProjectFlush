# Scrum Week #3
-------------
Working Version 1.0

Our game has included sound files as specified by the weekly challenge. The game is fully functioning, and playable at this time. The leaderboards, user interface, and instructions are still a work in progress and we hope to have the game all running on one webpage at the end of this project.
