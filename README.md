Working Version 1.0

Our game has included sound files as specified by the weekly challenge. The game is fully functioning, and playable at this time. The leaderboards, user interface, and instructions are still a work in progress and we hope to have the game all running on one webpage at the end of this project.

# Working Version 1.4

PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS! Rush to Flush now includes a leaderboard to play against anyone! Beat your highscore and rush to flush against your friends. The game will resize on the canvas if the game grid gets too big allowing you to continue playing with full view of the grid. The score/time/level text size has be increased for better visibility.

# Working Version 1.5

Graphics Update! If the game didn't look good before, it looks even better now! We have updated the graphics to give you some pleasing visuals to behold and you rush to flush in this latest update! We have also updated our leaderboards to give you an option of viewing our daily and overall leaderboards. This will give everyone a chance to get in the top 10! Also we have added a hint button for those that need a little extra help on a level. This will re-display the solution for the level when you press it, however you will be deducted 20 seconds from your overall time, and the timer will continue to count down. And finally, we have added achievements! Be sure to collect all the achievements hidden in the game! There are a total of 3 at the moment, but that's all the hints you'll get for now!

Best of luck to Rush to Flush!
