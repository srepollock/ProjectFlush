Description:
------------
Rush to Flush is a memory/speed game to test your short term memeory retention. This game progressively gets more challenging as you continue. Beat as manly levels as you can in 3 minutes and beat your highscore!

Code Structure:
---------------
This code is separated into different files. We have all JavaScript files in a script folder, as well as CSS in a style folder. This is to separate the code and make everything easier to understand. The pictures are all  under a pictures folder, and keep everything out of the way there. With the html/php code, all of that is in the root folder, and kept at the front for access and for website hosting.

Technologies Used:
------------------
HTML/CSS
JavaScript
PHP/SQL
AJAX
jQuery
Bootstrap

Issues/Problems Encountered:
----------------------------
Using new languages (JS, PHP)
GitHub
Overlapping audio during game
Touch screen double-tapping reactions on mobile
Database hacking
Getting the game to work across all major browsers (main problems with Internet Explorer).

Working Version 1.0

Our game has included sound files as specified by the weekly challenge. The game is fully functioning, and playable at this time. The leaderboards, user interface, and instructions are still a work in progress and we hope to have the game all running on one webpage at the end of this project.

# Working Version 1.5

Graphics Update! If the game didn't look good before, it looks even better now! We have updated the graphics to give you some pleasing visuals to behold and you rush to flush in this latest update! We have also updated our leaderboards to give you an option of viewing our daily and overall leaderboards. This will give everyone a chance to get in the top 10! Also we have added a hint button for those that need a little extra help on a level. This will re-display the solution for the level when you press it, however you will be deducted 20 seconds from your overall time, and the timer will continue to count down. And finally, we have added achievements! Be sure to collect all the achievements hidden in the game! There are a total of 3 at the moment, but that's all the hints you'll get for now!

Best of luck to Rush to Flush!
